Abstract:
The country’s health is already at stake and the ailing part is the ignorant behaviour we all have towards our biggest asset i.e., our Health.
Consumption of toxic elements such as cigarette, alcohol, drugs, etc., are the slow poisons of today’s generation hitting the Indian Youth’s, causing their uneven death, severe untreated diseases, and many more.
Someone have to step-up to make a halt at this drastic national issue, so we came up with an amazing idea, a mobile application to spread this awareness worldwide and to connect every age of users.
